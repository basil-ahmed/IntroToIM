### Assignment 3: Generative Art

#### Process:

I had a surgery this week and I was in the hospital. What I noticed was that there was a lot of art on the hospital walls. The art had multiple colors, and had a very calming effect.
I wanted to do something similar and thus my thought process before I started the project was to make a bunch of circles with calming colors that look visually appealing. 
I went on by making a class which takes the attributes for a circle, then added a method to add four circles surrounding it (symmetrical).
I made two loops and used them to fill the canvas with the sets of circle. I did this by creating objects of the class make_circle.
Now when you run the code, the colors are set with certain transparency so around the center (where circles overlap) the colors are darker and they get lighter as we go farther from the center.
I gave the circles a flashing effect and lowered the frame rate to give it a more pleasing effect. I also removed strokes.

#### Problems:
- Finding the colors
- Finding the perfect transparency amount
- Finding the frame rate for flashing of colors
- Finding the perfect dimensions for the circles to look correctly in place

#### Solutions:
- A lot of Trial and Error
- Mathematically calculated the dimensions

#### Result:
