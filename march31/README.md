### Assignment 5: Unusual Switch

The bulb lights up when you close the marker's cap, and it switches off when the cap is opened.

#### Process:
- I started by making the circuit and lighting up the bulb to make sure everything was working, and the circuit was correctly built.
- I took a copper wire and attached it inside the cap of the marker.
- Then I attached the end of the wire to the copper wire in the cap.
- I took another wire and attached it to the marker alongside another piece of copper wire.
- The other end of the wire went into the 5V slot.
- When both of the copper wire touch, the circuit is completed and the bulb lights up.

#### Problems:
- At first, the aluminium foil was run out in the IM Lab. Finding an alternative was extremely difficult.
- Took the copper tape as an alternative but it wasn't working because of not being conductive enough.
- Copper wire was extremely difficult to paste it in smaller spaces like the cap of the marker.
- It was hard to make it durable.

#### Solutions:
- Used a solution tape for pasting.
- Used a copper wire as the conductor.

#### Discoveries:
- A lot of interesting switches can be made with just two conductors touching eachother.
- With this simple concept, you can make something amazing like a burglar alarm.
