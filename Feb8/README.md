### Assignment 2: A Simple Work Of Art

#### Process:
I started with randomising the starting position of the line of squares with just a few squares in them.
I set the perfect spacing between the individual squares in the line followed by setting the spacing between the lines (randomised y co-ordinates).
Moving ahead, I randomised the weights of the strokes.
Till now, the squares and the lines are black and white. I randomised the fill colors of the square. Because the colors were too random, I chose random shades of blue.
I tried to change the stroke colors of lines and squares with the same random colors, it looked better.

Everytime you run the code it outputs a different result.

#### Problems:
- The randomising of the y-coordinates for the square lines was hard to figure out,
- Had to try a lot of stroke weights to find the most appropriate one,
- Had to try a lot of colors/color shades to find the most appropriate one,
- Making the program in as less lines as possible was a challenge.

#### Discoveries:
- When you combine randomness with a process, the result is beautiful.

#### Result:
Below are few of the results generated:
